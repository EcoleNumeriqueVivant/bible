This file list the documentation of useful tools for the day to day journey of
development teams.

Through the links below, we invite curious students to learn the basic and give
them details of the next move in the industry.

What is the purpose behind all this ? To learn them them new things ? Not only
for that by any means, but to enable them to understand the basic concepts of
computers and get in touch with individuals here with whom they have, right from
the start, a common interest and values, and to enable these people to become
their guides, advisers and friends during their journey.

Basic
=====

I know... It's hard but you should have an idea of what is behind the scene...

Unix Filesystem
---------------
The Unix file system (UFS; also called the Berkeley Fast File System, the BSD
Fast File System or FFS) is a file system used by many Unix and Unix-like
operating systems. It is a distant descendant of the original filesystem
used by Version 7 Unix.

Bash
----

Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project
as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. First released in 1989.

Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window, where the user
types commands that cause actions.

Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script.

Domain Name Server
-------------------
The Domain Name System is a distributed database of resource records (see [RFC1034]),
associating many types of information (e.g. IP address, mail exchanger, etc.)
with domain names. Similarly to the Unix file system, the structure of this
database is a hierarchical inverted tree, with the root at the top.

Address allocation for private internets (RFC 1918)
--------------------------------------------------
[RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918)

GNU/Make
--------
GNU Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other
non-source files of a program from the program's source files.

Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file called the
makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and how to compute it from
other files. When you write a program, you should write a makefile for it, so
that it is possible to use Make to build and install the program.

Markdown
--------
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax.

Git version control
-------------------
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to
handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Security
========

Please passwords, secrets are sensible so install this tool. And you will use it
to protect and secure your personal or applications secrets.

Password Store
--------------
Pass is the standard unix password manager, a lightweight password manager
that uses GPG and Git for Linux, BSD, and Mac OS X.
